        <div id="aboutme">Hello, my name is Harshit Patel and I am a 13 years old junior website 
             developer or programmer. <br><br> I got into this field because when i came to know that
             by learning programming, we can create our own websites and applications and show them 
             to whole world. I like to develop my own things and i can show it to everyone by making 
             them, that is even better. that's why I also started to learn programming. <br><br> 
             Currently I am learning and working with (HTML) hyper text markup language (CSS) 
             cascading style sheet and (JS) java script. My main focus is on java script which is
             more difficult than the other two languages, it is also because javascript is used
             to get the actiondone in a programm if we don't take any action in a programm then 
             the website seems bowring. <br><br> Now I am thinking that to make an application
             which looks good and also proves to be very helpful to common people.</div>
